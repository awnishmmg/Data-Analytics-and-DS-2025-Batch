1. IT Technology (20-25 Year's) we have working with IT Technology.

Ecommerce S/W

PHP
MERN 
Python

2. Data Technology (Evolve 30-50 Years):- 

MODULE 1: Foundations of Data Analytics
Duration: 2 Hours
Goal: Build the analytical mindset before touching tools

HOUR 1: What is Data Analytics (The Real Meaning)
1️. First, forget tools.
2. Data Analytics is NOT:
3. Excel formulas 
4. SQL queries 
5. Dashboards 

These are weapons, not the war.

2️. What is Data?
Data = raw facts without meaning
it should be recorded.

Examples:
100, 120, 90, 150
2024-01-01, Product-A, 5
Yes / No / Yes

On their own, they mean nothing.
3️ Data → Information
When you add context, data becomes information.
Example:
1. 150 orders today
2. Revenue dropped 12% last month
3. Customer churn increased

Analytics = converting data into information (context,relations,conversion...) → decisions

4️. Definition (Interview - safe)
Data Analytics is the process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and interpreting data to support better decision-making.

Keep this line in your pocket.
5️. Types of Analytics (VERY IMPORTANT)
Let’s go one by one — slowly.

1. Descriptive Analytics
2. Diagnostic Analytics
3. Predictive Analytics
4. Prescriptive Analytics

2D-2P Principal
2D-2P Analytical

1. Descriptive Analytics
Question it answers:
What happened?

Examples:
Last month sales = ₹10L
Website traffic = 50K users
20% customers churned

Tools:
Excel
SQL
Dashboards (Power BI or Tablue)

2. Diagnostic Analytics
Question it answers:
Why did it happen?

Examples:
Sales dropped because north region underperformed
Churn increased because price increased
Tools:
SQL
Excel Pivot
Drill-down analysis

3. Predictive Analytics
Question it answers:
What is likely to happen?
Examples:
Next month sales forecast
Probability of customer churn

Trends:-
============
1. loop-back data
2. historical data 
3. snapshot data 
4. metadata

These are used to Indentify the Trends.

Tools:
Python
Statistics
ML models

4. Prescriptive Analytics
Question it answers:
What should we do?
Examples:
Give discount to high-risk customers
Increase stock for fast-selling items

Tools:
Optimization
ML + Business rules

Golden Rule :=
===============
Most Data Analyst jobs = Descriptive (30%) + Diagnostic (70%)

Data Analytics vs Data Science vs ML vs AI
=====================================
Term				Meaning
1. Data Analytics	Past & present insights
2. Data Science	    Analytics + prediction
3. Machine Learning	Learning patterns from data
4. AI				Decision-making systems

Case Study:-
==============
Analytics is the foundation of everything.
Real-Life Analytics Examples
Swiggy
1. What sells most on weekends?
2. Which city cancels most orders?
3. Delivery time vs customer rating?

Amazon
1. Which products return most?
2. Which sellers are risky?
3. Which items to promote?

Netflix
1. What users watch after 9 PM?
2. Why users cancel subscriptions?

Mini Thinking Exercise (Do this seriously)
Question:
Q1 : Consider XYZ Limited, If sales dropped by 20% ?
what questions will you ask before touching data?

Answer should include:
1. Which region?
2. Which product?
3. Which time period?
4. Any price change?
5. Any marketing change?
This is analyst thinking.

HOUR 2: Analytics Lifecycle & Tools
Now let’s see how analytics actually works in companies.

Analytics Lifecycle (End-to-End)
Step 1: Business Problem
Wrong:
“I need a dashboard”
Correct:
“Why are customers leaving?”

Step 2: Data Collection
Sources:
Databases
	1. RDBMS (SQL)
		Oracle,MS SQL, SQL Server,
		DB2,Infinix DB, Postgres-SQL.
		
		Pre-defined Schema
		Structured.
		...
	2. Non-RDMBS (No SQL)
	    mongodb, Dynamodb, 
		scylla, BHive, HBase, 
		Cassendara, Memcache,
		Redis, CouchDB, CornerStone...
		un-structure 
		No schema.
		
		---> Convert --> Structured Data 
		
2. Excel files (csv,tsv,toons,json)
3. APIs
4. Logs (flats files,)
5. parquets
6. Web-Scraping.
7. ETL Pipelines 
8. WareHouse, Data Lake.

Examples:
Orders table
Customers table
Transactions table

Step 3: Data Cleaning (MOST,TIME-CONSUMING)
1. Missing values
2. Duplicate rows
3. Wrong data types
4. Messy text
80% time = cleaning

Step 4: Analysis (statistics Analysis,Probability Analysis.)
1. Filtering
2. Grouping
3. Aggregation
4. Comparisons
This is where SQL & Excel shine.

Step 5: Visualization
1. Charts
2. KPIs
3. Dashboards,Funnels.

Goal:
Make insights obvious even to non-tech people
Step 6: Decision

Examples:
Increase marketing budget
Remove low-performing product
Improve delivery speed

Insight without action = useless

Tools Used by Data Analysts :-
============================
Stage			Tools
Data collection	SQL
Cleaning		Excel / Python
Analysis		SQL / Excel
Visualization	Power BI / Tableau
Reporting		PPT / Dashboards
Converting Business Question → Analytics Question

Business Question:
Why are customers leaving?

Analytics Questions:
1. Churn % by month
2. Churn by region
3. Churn by product
4. Churn by price

Practical Task (Homework)
Take any app you use daily and answer:
What data it generates?
What analytics questions are possible?
What decisions can be taken?
