Today we will start with Python:-
==================================
1. what is Python :-

Python is a General Purpose, Simple, HLL, Dynamic, Object Oriented,
Extensible, Server Side,Interpreted and compiled scrpiting langauge.

General Purpose : a langauge which can used for any purpose. 
you can use python for web development, 
Enterprise Application, GUI Applications, Web Based Application, Emdedded Application, Data Application,
Intelligent System, IOT Use, Education college and school 9th and 10th Python CBSE and ICSE 
Python is All Rounder.

Simple : the langauage or syntax or rules of program in python is very easy, it is like writing English. it is easy to learn 
Even a Nursery Level or LKG Student Code in Python.

Eg:-
>>> print('Hi') if 5>6 else print('Hello')
Hello
>>> print('Hi') if 7>6 else print('Hello')
Hi
>>>

general languauge :-
=====================
1g : Binary Level or Machine Level
2g : Assembly Level 
3g : Mid Level (c,c++)
4g : HLL is 4rth generation (Programming English Like) (python,java,php,javascript)
5g : SQL is 5th generation

HLL : High Level Langauge 
C and Assembly, COBOL, FORTRAN 

Dynamic :-
=========
In Industry we have 2 types of PL 
1. Statically typed = type declaration is mendatory
2. Dynamically typed = type declaration is not mendatory

C/C++/Java langauge :-
int x = 20;
x = "Awnish" <----- it will give error.

Dynamically typed or Dynamic semantics.
x = 20 
x = True 
x = "Ravi"

Extensible:  Extend -> is there any chance of scalability or scope.

Python is also versitile or All Rounder.
1. Python can be used to build any type of application.
2. you can OS using python 

Java : scope is very limited.
.net : scope is very limited.

Python : Open Source -> Free ware (No Single Paisa to be invested)

Python is available in multiple flavours:-
python can with java : jython 
python can used with .net : Iron Python 
python can used with javascript : Brython
python can c : cpython 
python(v1) use python(v2) : pypy.

Python is interpreted and compiled langauge 
java -> JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

.Java ---> code -> compile -> using javac -> 
bytecode --> .class --> jvm ---> execute.

due to this feature is java is said to be Plateform 
independent 

Python -> PVM (Python virtual Machine)
.py ---> code ---> compile ---> .pyc <compiled python code> -> bytecode -> execute -> 

python is also plateform Independent.
All Intepreted lanaguge are scripting in nature.

scripting language = Intepreted + Dynamic semantics
PHP = Intepreter + Dynamic
Javascript = Intepreter + Dynamic

Difference B/w compiled and Interpreter :-
===========================================
Similarlity : Translator.
Differences

compiler :-
1. Code compiles/convert at once.
2. Code convert a intemediate code will be generated
3. Compiler it is experts 
4. it is slower in the execution.

p1.c --> p1.o --> p1.exe 
p1.py ---> .pyc ---> execute 

Interpeter:-
1. Code is coverted line by line 
2. execution is faster 
3. No Intermediate file is changed.

p1.py --Interpreter-> execute 

Python is a Object Oriented : you make your class and Objects. 

History:-
==========
1. Python was release in 1991 by guido van Raossum.
2. Python was never Intentional.
3. Python is no where related to snakes.
4. Python Named is derived from a very famous british Circus Tv - Show Monty Circus "Python" Show.
5. Python has 2 version 
	1. Python legacy : 2000 (2.x)
	2. Python Modern Version : 3.x 
	Latest Version Version : 3.13.x
	

How to start coding in python:-
================================
install python 
https://www.python.org/downloads/
Next Next next Yes Yes finish.

How to verify if the python is installed or not 
open cmd :-
python --version
